Adds a new desert planet. Almost all life which once populated this planet was wiped out by a cataclysmic event known as the Incineration. Survive in these harsh conditions and conquer Psammos.

The campaign is super unfinished and doesnt work properly. Everything might change in the future. I update it very often so reinstall it once in a while.

Thanks @thisiscrimsoncheck on Discord for Cavern map and Liquid Fuel Burner
